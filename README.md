iPhone-OCR-Tesseract-and-OpenCV
===============================


This is a sample project created by me (@PablosPoject) and @_AJ_R for academic purpose.
It use the OpenCV framework and tutorial made by BloodAxe and some other utilities class made by Aptogo.
It also uses the Tesseract OCR engine to read the text processed with openCV.

I also build a simple user interface that permit to take a photo or choose one from library, and also permit to apply to the image every single step in the image processing, or to apply directly all the processing.

I hope that these can be useful for someone!
Enjoy!
